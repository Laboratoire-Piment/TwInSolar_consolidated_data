Simulated production of the existing PV plants installed on the roofs of the ENERPOS, ESIROI and dept. 1 and 2 buildings in the Terre Sainte Campus 21°20'S, 55°29'E, 75m, GMT/UTC+4h
Note: The production of photovoltaic installations is recorded. However, 2 power plants (ENERPOS and ESIROI) belong to private operators and the recorded data presents numerous gaps and outliers. To solve these problems, we generated synthetic time series of photovoltaic production with the python pvlib library. The time series were calibrated to match the measured data.
